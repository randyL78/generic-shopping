# Generic Shopping Application

This project is combinging several parts of a standard online shopping platform
such as Amazon or Walmart into a generic project. The goal of the project is to
set up a full production grade workflow using K8s, Docker, and Skaffold to 
manage a multi-submodule project including React, Ruby on Rails, and perhaps 
Node/Express. It will use GraphQL as the communication link between client and
servers.
